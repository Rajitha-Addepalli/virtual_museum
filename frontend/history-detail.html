          <h2>Historical Context</h2>
          <p>The Magna Carta, sealed in 1215 CE, was a charter between King John and rebellious barons, addressing grievances over royal authority. It laid the foundation for constitutional law in England.</p>
          
          <h2>Historical Analysis</h2>
          <p>The document's clauses, like habeas corpus and trial by jury, established principles of justice and limited monarchy. Though initially a baronial agreement, it evolved into a symbol of universal rights.</p>
          
          <h2>Technical Aspects</h2>
          <p>Written in Latin on parchment, the Magna Carta was copied and distributed widely. Its preservation in lead cases and modern digitization ensure accessibility, with calligraphy reflecting medieval scribal art.</p>
          
          <h2>Cultural Impact</h2>
          <p>The Magna Carta influenced modern democracies, notably the U.S. Constitution. Its legacy in law and human rights is celebrated globally, with copies displayed in museums and referenced in legal education.</p>
